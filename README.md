# React Native Pixel Color

Returns the pixel color from a graphic at a given coordinate.

## Setup

Install the package:

React-Native 0.29.2+

```
npm install --save react-native-pixel-color
react-native link react-native-pixel-color
```

React-Native < 0.29.2
```
npm install rnpm -g
rnpm install react-native-pixel-color
```

### Android

Note: on latest versions of React Native, you may have an error during the Gradle build on Android (`com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Landroid/support/v7/appcompat/R$anim`). Run `cd android && ./gradlew clean` to fix this.

## Usage example

```javascript
import PixelColor from 'react-native-pixel-color';

PixelColor.getHex(imageUriOrData, { x, y }).then((color) => {
  // #000000
}).catch((err) => {
  // Oops, something went wrong. Check that the filename is correct and
  // inspect err to get more details.
});
```
